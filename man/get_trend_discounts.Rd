\description{
Regression based models use a linear trend to account for the change in level over time. 
In practical terms, it is measured as a vector of equidistant integers.
Often, the trend component can significantly impact the forecast in the long run. One way to solve
this issue is to apply a "discount" on the trend vector, henceforth, reducing the marginal effect on the 
predictions.
